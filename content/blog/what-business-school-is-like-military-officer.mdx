The first day of orientation, I walked into a classroom of 400 people and immediately noticed something. Most of them looked panicked. They were checking their phones, flipping through syllabi like they'd find a cheat code, and asking the admissions staff clarifying questions about questions. I stood there thinking: Okay, this is actually going to be fine.

Then the professor started talking about "ambiguous case studies" and how there's no right answer, and I felt my skin crawl.

Here's what business school is actually like when you're coming from the military.

## Where You'll Crush It

You've already won half the battle before you set foot in a classroom. The military trains you for exactly two things that matter in business school: execution under pressure and teamwork.

Case competitions? You'll dominate. I'm not saying this to pump you up. I'm saying it because case competitions are essentially military operations with whiteboards. You have incomplete information. You have a time constraint. You need to make a decision and defend it. You've done this in staff meetings. You've done this in the field. You know how to identify the critical path, assign tasks, and drive to a conclusion while half the room is still processing the first question.

Your study group will feel like a team. And you'll run it like one. You'll set schedules. You'll have people prepped on their assignments. You'll own your piece and know your teammates own theirs. Meanwhile, other groups are still deciding how to organize a 7 PM meeting. This is an advantage that compounds.

Presenting is not your problem. You've briefed generals. You've done situation reports in rooms full of people with more stars than a planetarium. A professor with a red pen doesn't scare you.

Deadlines? You respect them because they mean something. You'll turn in drafts early. You'll revise them. Other people will be crying at 11:47 PM the night before submission. You won't be one of them.

And the discipline of daily prep—the reading, the spreadsheets, the problem sets—feels like a reasonable workload because you've operated on far less sleep and under actual consequences.

## Where It Gets Weird

Here's where I had to recalibrate. Business school introduces a level of ambiguity that the military intentionally removes.

In the military, you have a chain of command. You have clearly defined objectives. You might not like the mission, but you know what the mission is. In business school, professors actively celebrate ambiguity. They present cases where two completely different answers are both defensible. They grade you on how well you argued your position, not whether you got it "right."

The first time I raised my hand and gave what I thought was a bulletproof answer and the professor said, "That's interesting; what about the other perspective?"—I wanted to ask if I'd misunderstood the question. I hadn't. There was just no clean answer.

You have to get comfortable with that, and it's uncomfortable for military people. Your instinct is to find the decisive action. Business isn't always about decisive action. Sometimes it's about positioning yourself for optionality.

Networking is a different beast, too. I trained to lead teams, not to work a room. Networking in business school feels artificial at first because it kind of is. You're talking to strangers at a mixer to build relationships that might help you later. In the military, your relationships are built through shared hardship and mission focus. Here, someone will hand you a business card after asking about your three-year plan.

You'll learn to do it. Just know that it doesn't come naturally, and you're not weird for feeling that way.

Finance is rough if you came from a non-finance background. I did. No one's going to give you partial credit for effort or for showing good judgment under uncertainty. You either know what WACC is or you don't. You either did the DCF correctly or you didn't. Go to office hours. Get a tutor if you need one. This is not the time to gut it out.

## The Study Group Dynamic

You're going to gravitate toward other military officers in your cohort, and that's not a bad thing. You share a language. You understand each other's backgrounds. You can joke about the absurdity of business school ambiguity without explaining what you mean.

But don't lock yourself into a military-only bubble. You need to work with finance majors, consultants, people with startup experience, and international students. They see problems differently than you do. You'll do case competitions with a former Bain consultant and realize your tactical rigor is only half the solution. They're thinking about market dynamics while you're thinking about execution efficiency. You need both.

Your military discipline will make you the default scheduler and taskmaster in your group. Lean into it, but don't become the person everyone relies on to herd cats. Push back when someone's unprepared. Hold people accountable. Your teammates need to step up the way they would on your team.

## The Social Scene and Recruitment

Business school has a social scene that's basically competition for face time with recruiters. There are student clubs, happy hours, dinners with company leaders, and recruiting events that run from September through January.

You don't have to attend all of them. In fact, you shouldn't. But you need to understand the game. Recruiters want to see you at events. They want to remember your name. You want to have multiple callbacks and offers to choose from.

It's different from military recruitment. There's no central process. You're essentially applying to every company you're interested in, and many companies make offers contingent on you recruiting with them (yes, you read that right). Your social capital matters because it signals interest and credibility.

The good news is you'll be a standout candidate. You've led people. You've managed budgets. You've made decisions with real consequences. You're not the kid who's never had a job. The harder part is explaining why you want to leave the military and why you want whatever position you're interviewing for. Have a good answer. A clear answer. Not a generic "I want to make an impact in business." That means nothing.

## The Real Takeaway

Business school is not that hard. It's different hard. The intellectual challenge is real, but it's not the core problem. The core problem is cultural adjustment. You're moving from a context where clarity and hierarchy are features to one where ambiguity and equality of voice are features.

You're going to be great at some things immediately. You're going to stumble on others and wonder if you made the right call leaving the military. You did.

By the second semester, you'll stop feeling like an outsider and start feeling like someone with a different perspective. That difference is your asset.
