You've got combat experience. You've led teams. You've operated under pressure. On paper, you should be a slam dunk for business school.

Then your application lands on an admissions officer's desk, and somehow it doesn't hit the way you expected.

This happens more often than it should. Military applicants have a real advantage. You also have a specific set of traps that are easy to fall into. I've seen them in my own applications, in talking with other veterans getting MBAs, and in reviewing essays from people applying to programs across the country.

Here are the five mistakes that kill your chances.

## 1. Using Rank as a Substitute for Leadership

Your resume says you were a major. A commander. A battalion sergeant major. That's on the page. The admissions committee sees it.

Now here's the problem: rank tells them what the military called you. It doesn't tell them what you actually did or how you think.

I've read essays from captains that made them sound like they'd never made a real decision. And I've read essays from junior officers that made them sound like they were running a Fortune 500 company.

The difference wasn't rank. It was clarity about what leadership actually entails.

**The mistake:** Leading with your rank and assuming the title carries the weight. "As a company commander with 100 soldiers reporting to me..." The number is supposed to impress. It doesn't work.

**The fix:** Flip it. Lead with the decision or the challenge, not the title. Instead of rank, tell them about the problem you owned. "I was responsible for recruiting and training soldiers who had failed basic training once already, and we had six weeks to prepare them for deployment-level readiness." Now you've told them something real. That's the work. The rank is context.

When you talk about your leadership, specificity beats hierarchy. Drop the rank mentions where they don't add anything. Replace them with what you actually managed: people, money, time, risk, competing priorities.

## 2. Generic "Leadership" Stories Without Any Real Specifics

This one goes hand in hand with mistake number one.

You write about how you "demonstrated leadership by motivating my team to achieve results." You "encouraged collaboration." You "set clear expectations and held people accountable."

These are true. They're also true for literally every person applying to business school. The admissions committee has read these exact phrases 500 times this cycle.

**The mistake:** Using leadership as a buzzword instead of a skill you can point to. You're telling instead of showing. You're using corporate language instead of your actual experience.

**The fix:** Get absurdly specific. What exactly happened? What did you actually say or do? What was the one thing that made the difference?

Here's a real example from my own work. Instead of writing: "I led my team through a complex transition," I wrote about the specific moment I realized my usual approach wasn't working. I'd scheduled a planning meeting, and I could see that two of my senior people were shutting down. They weren't buying in. So I stopped the meeting halfway through and asked them point-blank what I was missing. Turns out they had information I didn't have, and my plan had a flaw. We rewrote it together.

That's a specific moment. It shows judgment. It shows I could read a room and adjust. It shows I was willing to admit a mistake mid-stream.

Business schools want that story. They don't want "I demonstrated strong leadership."

When you write about leadership, describe the moment where the choice mattered. What did you see that told you the usual approach wasn't working? What did you decide to change? What happened as a result?

## 3. Ignoring the "Why MBA" Question

Some military applicants skip the "Why MBA?" question entirely or treat it like a box to check.

"I want to earn an MBA to accelerate my career trajectory." That's fine. It's also generic. It's what the dentist, the engineer, and the consultant all wrote too.

**The mistake:** Assuming business school is the obvious next step, so you don't need to explain why you specifically want it. Not doing the research on the school. Not connecting your military background to the MBA experience in a way that shows you've thought it through.

**The fix:** This is where you separate yourself. You have a specific reason to want an MBA that most applicants don't: you've already led people in high-stakes situations without an MBA, and you have a realistic sense of what you're good at and what you need.

Talk about that. What did you see in your military career that made you realize an MBA would help you? What specific skills or knowledge gap did you identify? Was it financial acumen? Strategic planning? Understanding how to scale organizations? Industry knowledge?

Then research the school. Look at their curriculum, their faculty, their student profiles. Find one or two things that are actually specific to that program. A particular course. A club. A faculty member's research that connects to your goals. Not "your program is highly ranked." They know.

Here's the version that works:

"In my role managing operations, I made resource allocation decisions without really understanding the financial modeling underneath them. I could optimize for effectiveness, but I couldn't optimize for both effectiveness and efficiency at scale. I realized I needed to understand finance and strategy on a deeper level. Your program's operations track and the consulting projects with real companies are why I'm applying here specifically. I want that discipline combined with learning from people who've done this at scale."

That's genuine. That's specific. That shows you've done the work.

## 4. Treating School Research Like a Box to Check

Connected to number three, but this one deserves its own slot.

You apply to ten schools. You write ten "Why This School?" essays. They're all interchangeable except for the school name.

Admissions officers can tell. And they definitely tell when your school research is lazy.

**The mistake:** Researching surface-level stuff. "I want to attend a school in a major city." "Your program has a strong alumni network." "You're ranked in the top 20." These are reasons to apply to forty schools, not reasons to apply to this one.

**The fix:** Actually visit if possible. Talk to current students. Read the program blog. Look at the clubs. Check out the electives that aren't offered at other schools. Go deep on one faculty member's research.

Then make your research count. Don't just mention it. Explain how it connects to your specific goals. What does this particular school offer that matters for your path?

And here's the thing about military applicants: you have an advantage here. Most schools want military veterans. Their career services teams know how to help you transition. Their alumni networks include people who've done it. Mention that. But only if you've actually looked into it.

Find the name of the person in career services who works with military veterans, if they have one. Mention the alumni network in your specific industry or location. Show that you've done more than spend ten minutes on the homepage.

## 5. Treating the Interview Like a Military Briefing

This one costs people. A lot.

You walk into your interview. You're prepared. You've got your talking points. You give crisp, direct answers. No filler. You cover the mission. You finish in five minutes.

And the interviewer looks at you like you've just landed a plane on the deck and immediately taxied back to the hangar.

**The mistake:** Assuming that the military communication style is the same as the business school interview style. Brevity and directness are good. But business school interviews want dialogue, not briefings. They want to understand how you think, not just what you've done.

**The fix:** Slow down. Give a longer answer. One of your leadership stories should take three to four minutes to tell, not thirty seconds. They want the setup. They want the choice you made. They want to hear why you made it. They want to know what you'd do differently.

They also want you to ask questions. Real questions. Not "What's the alumni network like?" (They'll send you the brochure.) Ask about the student experience. Ask about recruiting. Ask about the thesis project or capstone. Ask about something you actually wonder about.

Military interviews are interrogative. Business school interviews are conversational. You're sitting across from someone who's trying to figure out if they want to spend two years in cohort with you. Act like it.

Also, this is where tone matters. You can be direct without being clipped. You can be confident without being stiff. Be yourself, but be yourself in a conversation, not at a briefing.

## The Real Issue

These five mistakes all come down to the same thing: treating your military background like it's a credential to list instead of a lens to sharpen.

Your military experience is valuable. The admissions committee knows this. They don't need you to convince them that you're impressive based on rank or scope.

What they need is for you to show them how you think. What you learned. How you'd approach a completely different challenge like business school.

That's where the application gets won.

Fix these five things, and you've eliminated the traps that catch a lot of strong military applicants. Do that, and your military background becomes what it should be: your edge.
